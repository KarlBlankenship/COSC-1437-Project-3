#COSC 1437 - Project 3 - Search Comparison
Search Comparison will generate two files containing a defined amount of random integers.
One file will contain data and the other file will contain keys.
This program will search for each key within the data file.
This will be accomplished once with a simple linear search method and a second time with a binary search method.
Search times will be recorded for each type of search to see which search is fastest.
